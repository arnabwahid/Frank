**Frank is super fast & light.** It was built from scratch using only the WordPress best practices, standard APIs and features. It is as fast as it gets.

**Built-in theme customizer.** Frank uses the WordPress built-in theme customiser with live preview for quick and easy configuration of theme colors and interface elements. No custom options panels or frameworks that slow down your site and administration section.

**Profile photo from Gravatar.** Use your Gravatar profile image as a logo for quick personalisation which your readers will instantly recognise as your online identity. You can disable this feature in the theme customiser.

**Custom fonts & colors.** Over twenty hand selected high quality fonts from the Google Web Font library for both headings and body text. Optimised and loaded according to the best practices which you wonâ€™t find in any other WordPress theme or plugin.

**Widgetized footer area.** Add a search box, category archive or any other type of widget for easy access in the footer. Tinker places your content in the spotlight while making all the other important stuff accessible in the footer.

**Beautiful nested comments.** Blogs are about sharing your experiences and building a community with passionate readers and like-minded friends.

**Localisation and internationalization ready.** Fork the repository, translate Frank into your own language, place the language files inside `languages` directory and send me a PR.
