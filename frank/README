+Admin panels
	-Make Franklin Street a whole section in Wordpress admin
	-Be able to add/remove/reorder 'tiers' for home page

		-All tiers can be styled in four basic templates (basic, large type, 2 column & 4 column)
		-Tiers can choose specific categories to display
		-Make all options in functions.php accessible in admin panel
